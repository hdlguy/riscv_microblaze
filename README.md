# riscv_microblaze
A test of the new RiscV version of the Xilinx Microblaze processor.

## Files
- implement - scripts for building the fpga
- source - fpga source
- vitis - source code and scripts for the bare metal C code.

## Conclusion
The RiscV Microblaze is not as handy to use as the regular Microblaze. The edit-compile-test cycle is much slower because restarting the debugger is much slower with RiscV.
